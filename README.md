* What is this?

So, this was a set of django apps to take data from WoW gathered via lua plugins and contributed by various friends to make a dynamic database of resources and historical auction house prices.

It kind of worked, but interest in it petered out and it never went anywhere.

Why am I putting this up on github now?

Well, I was recently asked how long I have been working with Django, and while I can not access the Django projects that were done at my employer, I did, and stil do use it for my personal projects.

This project is so old it was started using CVS, converted to SVN, and then in 2023, exported from SVN, had all the told SVN history for non-related projects removed (hence the 'Commiter Date' being in 2023 and the 'Author Date' being in 2005.)

So mostly this is archiving an ancient project of mine as proof, that, yes, I have used Django since 2005.

NOTE: I had to extract this from a much bigger SVN repo, and then truncate out the early history that had nothing to do with this project. That is why the "initial commit" is 2023-10-25.
