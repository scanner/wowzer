The list of things that need to be done still, broken down in to
groups and sorted relatively in the order that they should be done in.

This list is being broken down in to several sections. It may require
items to be completed in more then one section for soem actual
functionality to be finished.

The reason for this was I needed to really track and decide what is
going to be on any given _web page_ and _form_ as well as what the
backend view and backend model need to accomplish.

    The following sql statement seems to be the one we need to find
    forums for which you have 'view' permission:

    select asforums_forum.id, asforums_forum.name from asforums_forum, auth_rowlevelpermission where auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31 and auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id and auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104 and auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f' and ((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)));

    NOTE: '31' is the content type id for forums, determined via:
          ctype = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(f) (where 'f' is a
          forum instance)

          '104' is the id from the auth permission table that
          corresponds to the 'view' permission for forums.

          '1' is the id of the user we are checking the permissions
          for.

          '2' is the content type id for users.

          content type for groups is 3, The user is in groups 1 & 3.

    This bascailly says if the user or a group he is in has the 'view
    forum' permission and it is not negative, then select that forum.

    (To extend this to dynamically check forum collections is not hard
    but may start to tax the db.)

    something like this? Forum.objects.extra(tables=["auth_rowlevelpermission"], where=["auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31", "auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id", "auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104", "auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f'","((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)))"])

o last seen
  o all discussion views need to show the user the last seen (by them)
    post
  o all views that have lists of discussions need to take an option
    "only show if this discussion has new posts since the last time I
    have been here."
  o have a toggle that sets whether discussions are filtered this way?
  o need to write a custom paginator that lets us update the 'last
    seen' flag for any listing of posts

o discussion subscriptions
  o let a user subscribe to a discussion
  o let a user de-subscribe to a discussion
  o on all lists of discussions provide a filtering mechanism that
    lets a user just see the subscribed discussions (should be easy to
    turn this filter on, should give them an easy way to by default
    only see subscribed discussions. There are several ways to do
    this, all  bit tricky. I think the simplest may be to present a
    url that let's them see subscribed discussions only, and have a
    separate link for 'all discussions'. The only different is
    probably a parameter "?subscribed" or something. (Need to make
    sure this is passed thorugh the paging mechanism.))
  o already mentioned on user profile page - on their profile page
    show a list of the subscribed discussions, and if those
    discussions have posts more recent then their last seen (and how
    many, and how long ago) also on this page is the ability to
    unsubscribe from a discussion, and a button to mark a discussion
    as fully seen.
