The list of things that need to be done still, broken down in to
groups and sorted relatively in the order that they should be done in.

This list is being broken down in to several sections. It may require
items to be completed in more then one section for soem actual
functionality to be finished.

The reason for this was I needed to really track and decide what is
going to be on any given _web page_ and _form_ as well as what the
backend view and backend model need to accomplish.

o post to discussions
  o permission to post:
    moderate permission on the forum
    or (post permission on discussion AND
        read permission on discussion AND
        (view permission on forum OR
         read permission on forum) AND
        (view permission on forum collection OR

    The following sql statement seems to be the one we need to find
    forums for which you have 'view' permission:
    
    select asforums_forum.id, asforums_forum.name from asforums_forum, auth_rowlevelpermission where auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31 and auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id and auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104 and auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f' and ((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)));
    
    NOTE: '31' is the content type id for forums, determined via:
	  ctype = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(f) (where 'f' is a
	  forum instance)

          '104' is the id from the auth permission table that
          corresponds to the 'view' permission for forums.

	  '1' is the id of the user we are checking the permissions
	  for.

	  '2' is the content type id for users.

	  content type for groups is 3, The user is in groups 1 & 3.

    This bascailly says if the user or a group he is in has the 'view
    forum' permission and it is not negative, then select that forum.

    (To extend this to dynamically check forum collections is not hard
    but may start to tax the db.)

    something like this? Forum.objects.extra(tables=["auth_rowlevelpermission"], where=["auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31", "auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id", "auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104", "auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f'","((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)))"])
