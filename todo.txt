    The following sql statement seems to be the one we need to find
    forums for which you have 'view' permission:
    
    select asforums_forum.id, asforums_forum.name from asforums_forum, auth_rowlevelpermission where auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31 and auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id and auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104 and auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f' and ((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)));
    
    NOTE: '31' is the content type id for forums, determined via:
	  ctype = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(f) (where 'f' is a
	  forum instance)

          '104' is the id from the auth permission table that
          corresponds to the 'view' permission for forums.

	  '1' is the id of the user we are checking the permissions
	  for.

	  '2' is the content type id for users.

	  content type for groups is 3, The user is in groups 1 & 3.

    This bascailly says if the user or a group he is in has the 'view
    forum' permission and it is not negative, then select that forum.

    (To extend this to dynamically check forum collections is not hard
    but may start to tax the db.)

    something like this? Forum.objects.extra(tables=["auth_rowlevelpermission"], where=["auth_rowlevelpermission.model_ct_id=31", "auth_rowlevelpermission.model_id=asforums_forum.id", "auth_rowlevelpermission.permission_id = 104", "auth_rowlevelpermission.negative='f'","((auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=1 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id=2) or (auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_ct_id=3 and auth_rowlevelpermission.owner_id in (1,3)))"])
