"""'ecs' stands for 'Extract Compress and Send.' These are a series of scripts
to extract relevant variable declarations from the named file (usually
SavedVariables.lua), compress it, and then send it to the specified wowzer app
on the specified http server.

This script is specifically for data for the madhouse module to process.  What
we are extracting are a couple of variables that the Auctioneer AddOn saves in
your SavedVariables.lua file.

We compress it because it is freaking huge, but plain text, so it
compresses well.
